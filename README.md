Contributions to these simulations are welcome! Submit a pull request via GitHub to modify one.

Note that increased complexity of the default commands or non-simulated subsystems will generally not be accepted 
(they are kept simple on purpose to leave room for users to experiment), but you are encouraged to download the simulation
and write your own commands / subsystems to experiment with automatically controlling these systems!
